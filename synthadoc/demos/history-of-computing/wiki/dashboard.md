## Contradicted pages — need review

```dataview
TABLE status, confidence, created
FROM "wiki"
WHERE status = "contradicted"
SORT created DESC
```

*These pages were flagged during ingest as conflicting with a newer source.
Open each one, resolve the conflict, then change `status` to `active`.*

---

## Orphan pages — no inbound links

```dataview
TABLE status, created
FROM "wiki"
WHERE length(file.inlinks) = 0
AND file.name != "index"
AND file.name != "dashboard"
SORT created DESC
```

*These pages exist but nothing links to them.
Add `[[page-name]]` to a related page or to [[index]].*
