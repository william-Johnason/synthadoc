# Journal Entries

Library of standard and non-recurring journal entries. Populate by ingesting account reconciliation forms from `raw_sources/reconciliations/` or by ingesting accounting policy documents.

Each journal entry record captures:

- **JE identity** — JE number, period, entity, preparer, approver, posting date
- **Account distribution** — debit and credit accounts (GL number + name), amounts, and net impact
- **Memo / business purpose** — plain-language explanation of what the entry records
- **Supporting evidence** — reference to invoice, contract, calculation schedule, or sub-ledger report
- **JE type** — standard recurring / accrual / reversal / adjusting / elimination / reclassification
- **SOX relevance** — whether the entry affects a significant account or process under SOX Section 404
- **Approval chain** — preparer, reviewer, and posting approver (for segregation of duties evidence)

**How to document journal entries:**

Recurring standard JEs are documented in the monthly close record in `raw_sources/close/`. Large or non-recurring adjusting entries should be documented in a separate reconciliation:

1. Copy `raw_sources/reconciliations/template-account-reconciliation.md`
2. Fill in the account detail and reconciling items
3. Run `synthadoc ingest raw_sources/reconciliations/<file>.md -w <wiki>`
