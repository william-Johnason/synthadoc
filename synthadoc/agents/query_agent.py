        # ── Knowledge gap detection ────────────────────────────────────────────
        # Three independent signals; any one triggers the gap:
        #
        #   1. Page count < 3  — wiki has almost nothing on the topic.
        #
        #   2. Max BM25 score < gap_score_threshold  — pages exist but their
        #      keyword overlap with the query is weak (tunable via
        #      [query] gap_score_threshold in synthadoc.toml; default 2.0).
        #
        #   3. Content overlap < 2  — BM25 scores are corpus-relative and can
        #      be inflated by shared vocabulary even when pages are off-topic
        #      (e.g. spring-flower pages match a vegetables query because both
        #      use words like "spring", "planting", "Canada").  This check
        #      counts how many retrieved pages actually contain at least one
        #      key noun from the question.  Key terms = question words longer
        #      than 4 chars that are not in _STOPWORDS, stem-truncated by 2
        #      chars for basic suffix matching (vegetable → vegetabl).
        #      If fewer than 2 pages pass this test, the wiki lacks on-topic
        #      content regardless of BM25 scores.
