"""Live end-to-end tests for the Orphan Resolver Workflow.

Each test creates dedicated pages (prefixed with _live-test-orphan-resolver-)
so they never conflict with real wiki content.  A finally block deletes all
created pages so the wiki is left in its original state.

Pages are written directly to the wiki filesystem (WikiStorage is file-backed,
and GET /lint/report reads from the same directory) rather than via a REST
endpoint — there is no POST /pages or DELETE /pages API.

Prerequisites:
  - synthadoc serve -w <wiki> running on SYNTHADOC_URL (default 127.0.0.1:7070)
  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or equivalent provider key) set

Run:
  pytest tests/live/test_orphan_resolver_live.py -v -s -m live

  SYNTHADOC_URL     Server base URL (default: http://127.0.0.1:7070)
