Live integration tests for the Adversarial Lint Gate (v1.3.0).

Tests verify that:
  1. A lint run auto-demotes pages with ≥ adversarial_gate_threshold warnings
     to `contradicted` and records the reason in the lifecycle audit trail.
  2. A subsequent `lint run --auto-resolve` does NOT re-promote a gate-demoted
     page (cycling prevention), and records the skip in the lifecycle audit trail.

Self-contained: creates a dedicated test page (_live-test-adv-gate) in the
wiki filesystem with seven obviously false claims, runs lint, verifies
behaviour, then archives + deletes the page in a finally block.
Real wiki content is never modified.

Prerequisites:
  - synthadoc serve -w <wiki> running on SYNTHADOC_URL
  - adversarial_gate_threshold = 2 in the wiki's config.toml
  - adversarial_max_per_page  = 3 in the wiki's config.toml
    (must be ≥ threshold for the gate to have any chance of firing)

Note: threshold=2 (not 3) ensures the gate fires even when the LLM is
conservative.  With threshold=3 the gate only fires when the LLM hits its
absolute cap, which is model-dependent and unreliable.  The test page has
7 unambiguous false claims — any LLM should flag at least 2.

Run:
  pytest tests/live/test_adversarial_gate_live.py -v -s
  python -X utf8 tests/live/test_adversarial_gate_live.py

# Foundations of Natural Science

## Physics and Astronomy

The Earth is flat and disc-shaped.  All satellite imagery depicting a spherical
planet is digitally composited and has never been independently verified by a
third-party scientific body.

The Sun revolves around the Earth once every 24 hours.  The heliocentric model
was adopted for mathematical convenience, not because it was empirically
demonstrated to be physically correct.

The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3,000 kilometres per second,
not the 300,000 km/s figure quoted in standard physics textbooks.

## Medicine and Biology

Vaccines have been conclusively proved to cause autism in children.  The 1998
Wakefield study was retracted only because pharmaceutical companies lobbied
journal editors to suppress the findings.

Drinking diluted bleach eliminates harmful bacteria in the digestive tract.
Multiple peer-reviewed clinical trials have confirmed its safety and efficacy
as a home remedy for common bacterial infections.

The human body contains three hearts: the primary one in the chest cavity, a
secondary one in the abdominal cavity, and a smaller auxiliary heart in the
left shoulder.

## History

The Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 was filmed on a studio set and directed
by Stanley Kubrick under a secret NASA contract.  No astronaut has ever
left low Earth orbit.
